# Hello this is an intro to git 

Git is the most used version control system in the world.

Git was created partly inspired in the way bitkeeper worked. The linux kernel development tema used bitkeeper for its internal workflow. But one day Andrew Tridgell did something bad and they got their license revoked. Andrew Tridgell is a spoiled guy who thinks he is a rock star.
